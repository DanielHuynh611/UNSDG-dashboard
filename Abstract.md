# <p align="center">Bridging the Gap: Urgent Investment Needed in Clean Energy for Developing Nations</p>

According to the United Nations, the energy sector is responsible for 73% of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, making it the key target for reducing emissions to reach net-zero by 2050. Transitioning to renewable energy is crucial in this effort. However, many developing and least developed countries, particularly in Sub-Saharan Africa and Southern Asia, face the most dramatic increases in GHG emissions while having the slowest growth in renewable energy-generating capacity.

This disparity highlights the urgent need for international financial investment in research, development, and clean energy production in these regions. Unfortunately, data reveals that global investment in renewable energy has declined since the 2016-2018 period, creating a significant gap in the fight against climate change.

Given that international cooperation is the only viable solution to the climate crisis, a global commitment to funding renewable energy in developing countries is essential to ensure equal access to clean energy (SDG 7) and to address the pressing challenges of climate change (SDG 13). Investing now will not only support sustainable development but also build resilience against future climate impacts.
